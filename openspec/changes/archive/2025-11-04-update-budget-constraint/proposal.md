## Why
The current budget constraint in `project.md` is too rigid, mandating the use of free tiers for all external services. This prevents us from proposing paid solutions even when they offer a significant return on investment.

## What Changes
The `Budget` rule in `project.md` will be updated to allow for paid solutions when a cost-benefit analysis is provided.

## Impact
- **Affected Specs:** project-conventions
- **Affected Code:** None directly. This change will influence the decision-making process for future features and architectural choices.
